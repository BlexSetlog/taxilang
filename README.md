# Taxi Language Server

[![VSCodePlugin](https://img.shields.io/badge/VSCode_Plugin-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio-code)](https://gitlab.com/taxi-lang/language-server/-/jobs/artifacts/master/download?job=package-plugin)

The visual studio code plugin is available from Gitlab.
Currently, it's not published to the VS Code Marketplace, but will be once the plugin matures.

The plugin can be installed and downloaded using the instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#packaging-extensions).

```bash
code --install-extension taxi-language-server-0.0.1.vsix
```

The plugin ships with a Taxi Language Server.  It requires java, 
so the JRE must be installed, and `JAVA_HOME` must be set as an environment variable.
