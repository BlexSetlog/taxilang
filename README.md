# Taxi

Taxi is a language for describing types and services.

It's key focusses are:

 * A highly descriptive type language
 * Readability
 * Extensibility / Composability

# Building the docs

Our docs live in `/docs` and are auto-deployed to Netlify.

To build and test the docs locally:

```bash
cd docs/
npm install
gatsby develop
```

 * Preview images are taken care of at build time
 * Search automatically updates by Agolia on deployment
