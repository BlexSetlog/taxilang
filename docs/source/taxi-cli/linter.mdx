The taxi compiler has a built-in linter, which can be used to enforce best practices across your team.

The rules can be configured, modifying their severity, or disabling entirely.  See <Link to="/taxi-cli/taxi-conf-file/#linter-config">Linter config</Link> in the taxi.conf documentation for more details.

## Rules

### `no-duplicate-types-on-models`

| Id | Default level  |
| :--- | :--- |
| `no-duplicate-types-on-models` |`WARN` |

This rule enforces that models do not allow the same type to be used for multiple fields.

Reusing a type multiple times on a model leads to ambiguity when querying.

For example:

```taxi
type Name inherits String
model Person {
   // Not permitted, as it leads to semantic ambiguity
   firstName : Name
   lastName : Name
}
```

### `no-primitive-types-on-models`


| Id | Default level  |
| :--- | :--- |
| `no-primitive-types-on-models` |`WARN` |

This rule encourages the usage of semantic types, rather than base primitives.

For example:

```
// Don't do this:
model Person {
   name : String
}

// Do to this:
type FirstName inherits String
model Person {
   name : FirstName
}
```
