description: Generates OpenAPI specs from your Taxi project

## Overview

The OpenAPI Plugin generates OpenAPI specs from your Taxi code.

## What's generated
OpenAPI specs describe a single API.  In Taxi parlance, that's the equivalent of a single `service`.

By default, all services that contain an operation with `@HttpOperation` annotations are generated.

```taxi
// No OpenApi spec is generated, as none of the operations
// include the @HttpOperation annotation
service NotGenerated {
   operation listAllPeople():Person[]
}

// Written to movies-service.yaml
service MoviesService {
   @HttpOperation
   operation listAllMovies():Movie[]

   // Not included in the generated OpenApi spec,
   // as it doesn't include an @HttpOperation spec
   operation doSomethingElse():Movie[]
}
```

The generated specs are named after the service - ie `MoviesService` generates `MoviesService.yaml`

### Controlling which services are generated
By default, all services that contain `@HttpOperation` annotated operation are generated.

This can be reduced down by passing a set of names or namespaces in the config:

```hocon
//taxi.conf
name: org.taxilang/demo

plugins: {
   taxi/open-api: {
      services: [
        "com.foo", // matches com.foo.MyService and com.foo.bar.MyService, etc
        "org.acme.PersonService" // matches only org.acme.PersonService
      ]
   }
}
```

### How paths are resolved
To ensure consistent generation of URLs, and compliant OpenAPI specs, you should decorate services
with an `@HttpService()` with a `baseUrl` property:

```taxi
@HttpService(baseUrl = "https://myMovies") // Generates a servers/url entry of https://myMovies in the OpenAPI spec
service MoviesService {
   @HttpOperation(method = "GET" , url = "/movies")
   operation findAllMovies() : Movie[]
}
```

Results in:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
   title: MoviesService
   version: 1.0.0
servers:
   - url: https://myMovies
```

If the `baseUrl` (or `@HttpService` annotation) is not present, the generator will attempt to detect a common baseUrl for the contained services.  This is a best-effort guess though.

## Configuration

| Name       | Usage                                                                                                                                     | Default  |
|:-----------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------|
| outputPath | Defines where the generated OpenApi specs are written.  This is relative to the output parameter in the main project config               | open-api |
| services   | A list of services to generate OpenAPI specs for.  If left empty, all services with operations containing `@HttpOperation` are generated. | kotlin   |


### Example:

```hocon
name: org.taxilang/demo
version: 0.1.0
sourceRoot: src/

plugins: {
   taxi/open-api: {
      outputPath: "open-api" // Optional
      services: ["PersonService"] // Optional
   }
}

```
