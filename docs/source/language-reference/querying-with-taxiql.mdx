## Overview
TaxiQL allows writing queries using your Taxi taxonomy -  allowing queries to be expressed independent of the services and models that are providing data.

When paired with a TaxiQL server such as [Vyne](https://vyne.co), this allows dynamic discovery of data, decoupled from the upstream services.

## Basic syntax
The basic syntax of a TaxiQL query looks like this:

```taxi
// Find all the people
find { Person[] }

// Find a person named Jim
find { Person( FirstName = 'Jim' ) }

// Find all the people named Jim
find { Person[]( FirstName = 'Jim' ) }
```

### Finding one thing, versus finding many
<Discourage>
Heads up! Historically, TaxiQL used to support two verbs - `findAll` and `findOne`.  These have been replaced with just `find`.  While the old
verbs are supported for backwards compatability, they will be removed in a future release.
</Discourage>

The type being queried for determines if a single result is discovered, or multiple.  To search for multiple entries, search for an array, using the `[]` symbol.


| Query                  | Meaning                 | What's called
|------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `find { Person[] }`    | Find all the people     | Fetch from all services returning `Person[]` or a subtype of `Person[]` |
| `find { Person }`    | Find a single person     | Fetch from a single service returning `Person` or a subtype of `Person` |


## Criteria
Criteria are specified in parentheses, after the type the criteria are applied to.

For example:

```taxi
// Find a person named Jim
find { Person( FirstName = 'Jim' ) }
```

This finds a `Person` model, with a `FirstName` value of Jim.

<Hint>
   **Important** Throughout taxi, we favour using Types, rather than field names, to describe attributes of data - it's the same here for querying.

   Referencing criteria using a type means that the criteria can be applied against a model regardless of the name of the field where the information is stored.
   This is especially powerful when querying multiple different models, each with a different structure.
</Hint>

### Combining multiple criteria
Multiple criteria are listed within the parentheses, and are always applied as an AND operation.
```taxi
// Find all people born in the year 2010.
find { Person( DateOfBirth > '2010-01-01', DateOfBirth <= '2010-12-31' ) }
```

The following operators are supported in a query - although support is determined by the actual services running.

| Symbol | Meaning      |
|--------|--------------|
| `=`    | Equal to     |
| `!=`   | Not equal to |
| `>`    | Greater than |
| `>=`    | Greater than or equal to |
| `<`    | Less than    |
| `<`    | Less than or equal to   |

## Projecting
When querying the result model can be specified using the `as` operator:

```
model Author {
   personId : PersonId inherits String
   firstName : FirstName
   lastName : LastName
}
model Book {
   title : BookTitle inherits String
   author : PersonId
}

// Create a type defining the desired output model
model BookAndAuthor {
   name : BookTitle
   authorName :  FirstName + ' ' + LastName
}

// Find books, and project to BookAndAuthor - a named type.
find { Book[] } as BookAndAuthor


// Find books, and project to an anonymous type.
find { Book[] } as {
   title : BookTitle
   authorName : FirstName + ' ' + LastName
}
```

## Joins and Discovery

## Linking data and `@Id`
<Hint>This behaviour is down to server engines.  What's documented is the reference behaviour as implemented by Vyne.  However, other service implementations may vary.</Hint>

When querying across multiple models, data is automatically discovered by calling services that return the requested data.
However, sometimes you need to be specific about what values are appropriate to use for lookups.

When a `model` exposes an `@Id` attribute, then only services that accept that id will be invoked when trying to link data.

For example:

```
model Movie {
   @Id
   id : MovieId inherits String
   title : MovieTitle inherits String
   yearReleased : YearReleased inherits Int
}
model Review {
   movie : MovieId
   score : ReviewScore inherits Int
}
service ReviewsService {
   operation getReview(MovieId):Review
   operation getBestReviewForYear(YearReleased):Review
}
```

Given the above model, we can issue queries such as:

```
find { Movie[] } as {
   title : MovieTitle
   score : ReviewScore
}[]
```

There are two paths to discover a `ReviewScore` from the data available in a `Movie`:

 * `Movie -> MovieId -> getReview(MovieId) -> Review -> ReviewScore` (Correct!)
 * `Movie -> YearReleased -> getBestReviewForYear(YearReleased) -> Review -> ReviewScore` (Incorrect!)

Therefore, to restrict the type of data that can be discovered, models can define an `@Id` attribute.

When discovering data from services for models that contain an `@Id`, *only* operations that accept the `@Id` value as an input
will be considered.

This excludes the incorrect path.

## Joins
It is possible to request data joined across multiple models.

Using a join affects the number of rows that are returned to the output.

<Hint>
   It's not always necessary to specify a join.  If you simply want to discover linked data, include the desired information in your output type.

</Hint>

### by

`by` is used to relate data explicit using a field.
By default, data is linked using `@Id` annotated attributes.

For cases where you need a different link, use `by`.

```
type PersonId inherits String
model Person {
   @Id id : PersonId
   name : PersonName
}
model Movie {
   id : MovieId
   title : MovieTitle
  // We should make ambiguous types on models prohibited, unless they are inline refined as follows.
   directedBy : DirectorId inherits PersonId
   producedBy : ProducerId inherits PersonId
}

operation listMovies():Movie[]
operation getPerson( PersonId ) : Person
operation listMoviesByActor( ActorId ) : Movie[]

find {
  Movie[]
} as {
  id : MovieId
  // The below would be illegal without the (by) clause, as PersonName is ambiguous.
  directorName : PersonName( by DirectorId )
  producerName : PersonName( by ProducerId )
}
```

We can also use `by` to scope data blocks.

```
find {
  Actor[] // Define a start point
} as {
  name : ActorName
  movies : [
    {
       title : MovieTitle
       year : YearReleased
     }
  ]( by ActorId )
}[]
```

## Enriching from multiple sources with `@FirstNotEmpty`
Often, there's more than one place to discover data across an organisation.
And sometimes one system will contain missing data, that can be populated elsewhere.

However, it's difficult for tooling to understand when a null value is legitimately null, versus when it's
appropriate to look for data elsewhere.

That's where `@FirstNotEmpty` comes in.

Adding `@FirstNotEmpty` onto attributes in a query response (either on a response model, or an inline anonymous response)
instructs query servers to keep looking for strategies to populate the data.

For example:
```
model Person {
   @Id
   id : PersonId
   name : PersonName inherits String
   email : EmailAddress inherits String
}

service CustomerStore {
   operation findAllPeople():Person[]
}

[[ A person returned from a 3rd party CRM system ]]
model CrmPerson {
   personId : PersonId
   email : EmailAddress
}
service CRMPlatform {
   operation findPerson(PersonId):CrmPerson
}
```

Here, we see two different systems in an organisation that contain information about people.

```
findAll { Person[] } as {
   personName : PersonName
   emailAddress : EmailAddress
}
```

Issuing this query would return all the data from the `CustomerStore`, formatted into our result type with two properties.
Any null values present in the `CustomerStore` would be left as-is.

However, if we want to enrich from other sources, we can instruct query servers to try to discover missing values:

```
findAll { Person[] } as {
   personName : PersonName
   @FirstNotEmpty
   emailAddress : EmailAddress
}
```

By adding `@FirstNotEmpty` to the `emailAddress` attribute, it instructs query servers to look for data in other data stores.

As discussed in <Link to="#linking-data-and-id">Linking data and `@Ids`</Link>, if models expose an `@Id` attribute, then only
services that accept the `@Id` will be used for enrichment.

In this case, for any results that a re missing an `emailAddress`, the `findPerson` operation will be invoked, passing the id, and looking up the email address.
The email address from those calls will be merged into the result.
