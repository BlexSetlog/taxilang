title: Functions in Taxi
description: Declaring functions in Taxi
---

## Overview

Taxi provides support for declaring functions that can manipulate data.

Taxi itself does not provide implementations of these functions - it's down to individual runtimes, such
as [Vyne](https://vyne.co).

## Declaring functions
Functions are declared as follows:

```taxi
namespace com.foo {
   declare function concat(String,String):String
}
```

This declares a function named `com.foo.concat`, which accepts two `String` arguments, and returns a String.

### Parameter names
Parameters may be optionally declared with parameter names:

```
namespace com.foo {
   declare function concat(first: String,second: String):String
}
```

### Vararg parameters
The final parameter in a function may be declared as vararg by providing a trailing `...`

```
namespace com.foo {
   // values is vararg, and can accept multiple values
   declare function concat(something: Int, values:String...):String
}
```


## Using functions
As with all other references, functions must be imported to be used,
or referred to using their fully qualified name

### Functions in fields
Functions can be used in expressions on models by declaring using a `by` operator:

```taxi
import com.foo.concat

model Person {
   firstName : FirstName inherits String
   lastName : LastName inherits String
   fullName : FullName inherits String by concat(FirstName, ' ', LastName)
}
```

As with all expressions, parameters are passed either by Type reference, or Field reference:

```taxi
import com.foo.concat

model Person {
   firstName : FirstName inherits String
   lastName : LastName inherits String
   // By default references are assessed as lookups by type.
   fullName : FullName inherits String by concat(FirstName, ' ', LastName)
   // When prefixed by 'this.', lookups are assessed against field names
   formalName : String by concat(this.lastName, ', ', this.firstName)
}
```


### Functions in expression types
Functions may also be used in expression types.
When functions are referenced as a type, the underlying base type
is optional, and can be inferred by the compiler

```
declare function concat(String...):String

// FullName inherits String, as that's
// the return type of `concat`
type FullName by concat(FirstName, ' ', LastName)

model Person {
   firstName : FirstName inherits String
   lastName : LastName inherits String
   fullName : FullName
}
```

### Lambda functions
Taxi has support for declaring lambda functions - i.e.,
functions as parameters to another function.

```
declare function stringify(Int[], callback:(Int,String) -> String):String
```

### Generic types
Taxi has limited support for generic types in functions.

Type arguments may be before the function name:

```
declare function <T,A> reduce(T[], (T,A) -> A):A
```

## Taxi Stdlib
Taxi ships with a StdLib which contains a number of functions declared to assist
with manipulating data.
