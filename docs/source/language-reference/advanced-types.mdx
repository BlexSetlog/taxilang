description: Techniques for mapping messy, real-world data
---


import {Discourage, Hint} from "../components/hint";

These features describe techniques used when mapping data to semantic values when things don't neatly line up, or when enriching another representation of a model.

These are often useful when mapping data provided by a system outside your control, but can be used anywhere.
Additionally, these techniques can be applied to incrementally expose existing data to the semantics of your type system.

## Field accessors
Field accessors describe a way of reading data into a field from somewhere within a document.

By default, taxi assumes that the content that is being described read matches the structure of the content.  However, for some content (such as CSV), or for external content, this isn't always possible.

<Discourage>

   Accessors are being replaced by [expressions](#expressions).

   They still provide access for `jsonPath()`, `column()` and `xpath()`,
   but are deprecated for all other usages.

</Discourage>

### Describing CSV data - `column()`
CSV data can be described in taxi using `by column()` syntax, passing either the header name or the column index.

eg:

```
model Person {
    firstName : FirstName by column('firstName')
    lastName : LastName by column('lastName')
}
```

The value passed can either be:

 * the name of the column
 * the index of the column.  Indexes are assumed to be 1-based.  (That is, the first column is index 1, not index 0).

### Describing Json data - `jsonPath()`
By default, json data can be parsed by Taxi without any special markup.
However, if you wish to expose a value from elsewhere in a document, you can use a jsonPath expression:

```
model Person {
    firstName : FirstName by jsonPath('$.person.names.FirstName')
}
```

Parsers will read the `firstName` attribute from the specified jsonPath.

#### Relative JsonPath:

```taxi
type Oscar inherits String
model Actor {
   name : ActorName inherits String
   awards : {
      mostRecentOscar: Oscar by jsonPath("oscars[0]")
   }
}
```

Given the following json:

```json
[
   {
      "name" : "Tom Cruise",
       "awards" : {
         "oscars" : [ "Best Movie" ]
       }
   },
   {
      "name" : "Tom Jones",
       "awards" : {
         "oscars" : [ "Best Song" ]
       }
   }
]
```

This line: `oscars: Oscar by jsonPath("oscars[0]")` would flatten out the oscars property to the first value - ie:

```json
[
   {
      "name" : "Tom Cruise",
       "awards" : {
         "mostRecentOscar" : "Best Movie"
       }
   },
   {
      "name" : "Tom Jones",
       "awards" : {
         "mostRecentOscar" :  "Best Song"
       }
   }
]
```

### Describing Xml data - `xpath()`
By default, xml data can be described by Taxi and parsed by parsers without any special markup.
However, if you wish to expose a value from elsewhere in a document, you can use an xpath expression:

```
model Person {
    firstName : FirstName by xpath('//person/names[@type = 'firstName]/name')
}
```

Parsers will read the `firstName` attribute from the specified xpath.


## Conditional logic - when blocks
Conditional fields let you expose semantic data based on values from other fields within the model.
This is useful when parsing semi-structured data into a semantic model.

```
model Person {
    homePhone : HomePhoneNumber by column("homePhone")
    workPhone : WorkPhoneNumber by column("workPhone")
    preferredPhone : String by column("preferredPhone")
    preferredPhoneNumber : PreferredPhoneNumber? by when (column("preferredPhone")) {
        "Home" -> this.homePhone
        "Work" -> this.workPhone
        else -> null
    }
}
```

When blocks are very flexible, and analogous to a series of `if...then...else` statements .  They support matching either on a specific value:

```
// switching on a specific value
model Person {
    preferredPhone : String by column("preferredPhone")
    preferredPhoneNumber : PreferredPhoneNumber? by when (this.preferredPhone) {
        "Home" -> this.homePhone
        "Work" -> this.workPhone
        else -> null
    }
}
```

or matching on the first `true` result:

```
model Person {
    preferredPhoneNumber : PreferredPhoneNumber? by when {
        this.preferredPhone == 'Home' -> column("homePhone")
        this.preferredPhone == 'Work' -> column("workPhone")
        else -> null
    }
}

```

The conditions in a when block may make reference to other fields, and perform the following comparisons:

| Symbol | Meaning      |
|--------|--------------|
| `==`    | Equal to     |
| `!=`   | Not equal to |
| `>`    | Greater than |
| `>=`    | Greater than or equal to |
| `<`    | Less than    |
| `<=`    | Less than or equal to   |
| `&&`     | And          |
| \|\| | Or           |


Here's a more complex example:

```taxi
enum OrderStatus {
    Unfilled,
    Rejected,
    PartialFill,
    FilledCompletely
}
model PurchaseOrder {
    sellerName: String?
    status: String?
    initialQuantity: Decimal?
    remainingQuantity: Decimal?
    quantityStatus: OrderStatus by when {
        this.initialQuantity = this.leavesQuantity -> OrderStatus.Unfilled
        this.trader = "Marty" || this.status = "Foo" -> OrderStatus.Rejected
        this.remainingQuantity > 0 && this.remainingQuantity < this.initialQuantity -> OrderStatus.PartialFill
        else -> OrderStatus.Unfilled
    }
}
```

## Expressions

<Hint>

   As with everything in Taxi, evaluation of expressions is left to a parser / runtime,
   like [Orbital](https://orbitalhq.com).

   This document outlines the expected spec of expressions, but Taxi itself does not ship
   with an evaluation engine.
</Hint>

Expressions can be declared either on a type directly, or on a field.  They can be simple
statements, or include [function calls](#functions).

As statements, expression can use the following operators:

| Symbol | Meaning  |
|--------|----------|
| +      | Add      |
| -      | Subtract |
| *      | Multiply |
| /      | Divide   |


Expressions can also perform comparisons, using the same operators described in [conditional logic](#conditional-logic---when-blocks).


### Expression types

```
type Height inherits Int
type Width inherits Int

// A simple expression, multiplying two fields
type Area inherits Int by Width * Height

// Expressions may mix references to other types, and constants
type WhackyArea inherits Int by (Width * Height) / 2

// Expressions can call functions
type FullName inherits String by concat(FirstName, ' ', LastName)
```

### Expression on fields

Fields in a model may declare expressions inline.

In addition to standard syntax used in expression types, fields may also
make reference to other fields, using `this.fieldName` syntax

eg:

```taxi
model Purchase {
    price : PerItemPrice
    quantity : Quantity
    total : TotalCost by (PerItemPrice * Quantity)
    // alternatively:
    anotherTotal : TotalCost by (this.price * this.quantity)
}
```



### Special calculation operations

Calculation operations aren't limited to just numeric types.  The following special operation types are supported:

| Operation       | Result type | Effect        | Example                                                      |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `String + String` (Deprecated) | `String`      | Concatenation | `fullName : FullName by (this.firstName + this.lastName)`    |
| Date + Time     | Instant     | Combines      | `timestamp : Instant by (this.recordDate + this.recordTime)` |
|                 |             |               |                                                              |

<Discourage>

   Concatenating strings using the `+` operator is deprecated. Consider using the `concat` function instead.

</Discourage>
Note: Taxi does not perform the evaluations.  This is left to parsers to handle.

As such, other parsers may provide additional operations.  The above outlines the capabilities supported by Orbital.


## Referencing other fields
When referencing other fields, either in functions, or when classes, you can reference the field in one of two ways:

| Method        | Syntax         | Example              |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| By field name | this.fieldName | when(this.firstName) |
| By type       | FieldType      | when(FirstName)      |


## Type Extensions

Type extensions allow mixing in additional data to a type after it's been defined.

It's possible to extend a type by adding either annotations, or type refinements.  Structural changes to types are not permitted \(and the compiler will prevent them\).

Type extensions can be defined either in the same file, or \(more typically\), in a different file from the original defining type.

```taxi
// As defined in one file.
type Person {
    personId : Int
    firstName : String
    lastName : String
}

type alias FirstName as String
// Extending the type to provide additional context:
type extension Person {

    // Adding an annotation.  No additional type is defined, so the
    // underlying type remains the same -- an Int
    @Id
    personId

    // Refining the type.  Note that FirstName represents the same
    // type as the original String, so this is permitted.
    // If the types were incompatible, the compiler would alert an error
    firstName : FirstName
}
```

There are a few scenarios where this may be useful:

### Adding documentation
If consuming a third party API via a format like Swagger, it's useful to mix in consumer
specific documentation.

Type extensions allow this, by adding taxidoc to the types

### Refining types with semantic types

Not all languages and spec tools are created equal - and some don't have great support for
semantic types.  Extensions allow for the narrowing \(but not redefinition\) of the type,
through specifying more narrow types.

The compiler will prevent type extensions from introducing incompatible type changes.

The compiler also restricts type refinements to a single refinement per type

### Mixing-in metadata

A consumer of an API may wish to leverage tooling that uses annotations - eg.,
persisting an entity into a database.

Type extensions allow providing tooling specific metadata that's only useful to the
consumer - not the producer.

## Functions

Taxi allows for the declaration of functions, which can be used within a type spec.

As with everything in Taxi, evaluation of functions is left to a parser / runtime,
like [Orbital](https://orbitalhq.com).

As Taxi doesn't support evaluation, functions are declared simply by declaring their
interface.  There is no ability to express the implementation of a function within Taxi.

### Declaring functions

Functions are declared with a name, a list of inputs, and a return type:

```taxi
declare function uppercase(String):String
```

These can then be used within expressions:

```taxi
model Person {
   title : Title by uppercase(Salutation)
}
```

### Vararg parameters
A function may declare it's final parameter as `vararg`, which means that
multiple arguments may be provided.

Vararg is only permitted in the final argument.

```taxi
declare function concat(String...):String
```

### Generics
A function may declare a generic type signature.
The Taxi compiler will infer types, and ensure that passed parameters
in usages adhere to contracts.

```
declare function <T,A> reduce(T[], (T,A) -> A): A
```
