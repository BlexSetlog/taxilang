## taxi cli

[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/taxi-lang/releases/taxi-cli/images/download.svg) ](https://gitlab.com/taxi-lang/taxi-lang/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/taxi-cli/target/taxi-cli.zip?job=publish-release)

The `taxi` command line tool provides access to the compiler - which validates the syntax of taxi projects  - and allows plugins of generators to create models and services in different languages and frameworks.

## Getting started

[Download](https://gitlab.com/taxi-lang/taxi-lang/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/taxi-cli/target/taxi-cli.zip?job=publish-release) the latest release taxi-cli.  Unzip the .jar file

```bash
 curl -s "https://gitlab.com/taxi-lang/taxi-lang/raw/master/install-cli.py" | python3
```

This will install the `taxi` command line tool.

## Project overview

A typical taxi project will be laid out as follows:

```text
project/
├── src/
│   ├── someTypes.taxi
│   └── moreTypes.taxi
└── taxi.conf
```

## taxi.conf

A `taxi.conf` file describes a project's layout, and the plugins to be invoked after compilation.  It follows the [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#hocon-human-optimized-config-object-notation) format, which is like supercharged JSON.

## Plugins

Taxi's compiler and language generators are extensible and pluggable.

You can leverage our existing plugins to generate code, or author your own.  Read more about plugins <Link to="../../plugins/README">here</Link>
