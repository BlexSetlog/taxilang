You can author your own plugins which hook into the Taxi compilation and code generation process by implementing the `ComponentProviderPlugin` interface.  

The [taxi-jpa](https://gitlab.com/taxi-lang/taxi-lang/-/tree/develop/plugins/taxi-jpa) project is provided as a sample to show how to implement your own plugins.
