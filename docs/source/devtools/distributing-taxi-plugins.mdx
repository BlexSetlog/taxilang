import { Link } from "gatsby"

Distributing plugins is currently only supported via our experimental platform, <Link to="/devtools/taxi-hub">Taxi hub</Link>.

We will likely add support for distributing plugins via Nexus in the near future.  If this is of interest to you, get in touch via
our slack channel to let us know.
