## 1.30.5

This is a feature release, which introduces the following language changes

### Specifying projections on nested collections (Feature)

A TaxiQL projection can now include specific projections for nested collections.

```taxi
find { Transaction[] } as {
   items : TransactionItem -> {
      sku : ProductSku
      size : ProductSize
   }[]
}[]
```

See <Link to="/language-reference/querying-with-taxiql/#projecting-nested-collections">projecting nested collections</Link>
for more details

### String replace function (Feature)

The String 'replace' function has been added to Taxi lang

```taxi
replace(String, String, String)
Replaces the contents of the provided String, returning a new String
      Accepts three args:
       * String: The string to search
       * String: The string to search for
       * String: The string to use as a replacement
      ]]
```

Example usage

```taxi
model Trade {
    symbol : String
    ccy1 : String by replace(this.symbol, "TEXT_TO_REPLACE", "REPLACEMENT_TEXT")
}
```

## 1.30.6

This is a minor internal release, which contains changes to internal tooling

### Mapping of java Boolean type to Taxi Boolean types (bug)
Code generators were unable to map the java Boolean type to Taxi when declared from Kotlin code.

### OpenApi fields are non-null by default (change)
When generating taxi schemas from OpenApi specs, the generated types have non-nullable fields, unless explicitly
defined using the OpenApi nullable attribute.

## 1.30.7
This is a minor internal release, which contains changes to internal tooling

### Bug fixes

#### Annotation types now have their code correctly generated when they contain fields or other annotations (bug)

#### Internal sourceCode attributes of taxi types now try to generate valid self-contained source (bug)
Previously, we just emitted the source as it was declared in the original file.
We now try to make this source self-contained, adding missing namespace declarations and
imports for dependent types.
