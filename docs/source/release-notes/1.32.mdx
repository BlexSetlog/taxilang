This page contains details of releases in the 1.32.xx set of releases.

## 1.32.0

### Json schema converter (feature)
We added the JsonSchema importer project, which can convert
a Json Schema to taxi.

It's currently used programmatically.  See the unit tests for examples.


### Protobuf schema converter (feature)
We added the Protobuf importer project, which can convert
a Protobuf to taxi.

It's currently used programmatically.  See the unit tests for examples.


### Standardisation of operators (breaking change)
Usage of operators has been standardized.

 * `==` is used consistently for equality checks (eg., in queries)
 * `=` is used consistently for assignment (eg., in given clauses)
 * Expression syntax has now been made consistent throughout.

### Lambda types (feature)
Types can now be declared which are the result of a computed expression.

For example:

```
type WeightedAverage by (Entry[]) -> reduce(Entry[], (Entry, Int) -> Int + (Weight*Score))
```

### Lambdas in functions (feature)

Function declarations can now include generics and lambdas

For example:

```
declare function <T,A> reduce(T[], (T,A) -> A):A
```


### Anonymous types in query body (feature)

TaxiQL queries can now support projecting to an anonymous type, rather than a predefined one.

For example:

```
find { Movie[] } as {
  // The type is defined inline within the query body
  id : MovieId
  title : MovieTitle
  description : Description
}
```
