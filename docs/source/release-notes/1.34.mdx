# 1.34.0

## Add `table` and `stream` declarations in services (feature)
Added first-class support for `table` and `stream` declarations in services, for describing database tables and streaming message sources respectively.

Eg:

```
service MyDatabase {
   table movies : Movie[]
   table actors : Actor[]
}

service MyKafkaBroker {
   stream prices : Stream<StockPrice>
}
```
