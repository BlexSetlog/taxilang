Breaking change:
## Comparison operator has changed from `=` to `==` to align with standard conventions
This is big, it impacts things like query predciates:

```
type SomeServiceRequest {
// This now needs == not =
   amount : Money(this.currency == 'GBP')
   clientId : ClientId as String
}
```


 * `as` on model types has been removed, and is now consistently using `by`
```
model Person {
// Old
   fullName : FullName as (FirstName + LastName)
// new
   fullName : FullName by (FirstName + LastName)
}
```
 * Order of evaluation in `by` expressions is now standard and consistent
