Breaking change:
## Comparison operator has changed from `=` to `==` to align with standard conventions
This is big, it impacts things like query predciates:

```
type SomeServiceRequest {
// This now needs == not =
   amount : Money(this.currency == 'GBP')
   clientId : ClientId as String
}
```


 * `as` on model types has been removed, and is now consistently using `by`
```
model Person {
// Old
   fullName : FullName as (FirstName + LastName)
// new
   fullName : FullName by (FirstName + LastName)
}
```
 * Order of evaluation in `by` expressions is now standard and consistent

# When clauses must prefix field references with 'this'
Referencing of fields now consistently must be prefixed with `this.`.

eg:

```
model Movie {
   name : Name
   rating : MovieRating
   whenClauseField : Thing by when (this.rating) {
      "foo" -> name // <- This is now an error, field names must be referenced as `this.name`
      "foo" -> this.name // <- This is correct
      else -> ...
   }
}
```
