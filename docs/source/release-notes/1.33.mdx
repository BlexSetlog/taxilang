This page contains details of releases in the 1.33.xx set of releases.

## 1.33.0

### Updated to Kotlin 1.6
The codebase is now compiled against Kotlin 1.6

### New collection functions in stdlib

stdlib now includes the following collection functions:

 * `noneOf()` - Testing if a collection contains none of the provided values
 * `anyOf()` - Testing if a collection contains any of the provided values
 * `allOf()` - Testing if a collection contains all of the provided values

## 1.33.1

### Bug fixes
 * fix error thrown when annotation types don't specify nullable properties

## 1.33.2

### Documentation fixes
 * fix outdated docs with reference to equality (`=` vs `==`)
 * Added docs on functions

## 1.33.3

### Internal fixes
 * Special taxiQL projection type has been removed, and replaced with a standard type reference
 * Compiler doesn't report errors in queries if the token can be unambiguously resolved
 * Updated license information in pom

## 1.33.4

### Internal fixes
 * Updated license information in pom (again)

## 1.33.5

### Improved kotlin type detection
Previously when generating taxi from kotlin code, it was required to pre-register packages, in order to correctly extract
type information from type alises.

This has been improved, and now packages are scanned on-demand.

### Bug fixes

 * Braces inside of comments or markdown blocks were causing errors in taxi formatter
 * (jsonschema-importer): If a type is used in an Array and then as a non-array type, all references were getting treated as array types
 * (jsonschema-importer): Types with different schemas but same field names were using incorrect types on second (and subsequent) usages.  We're now generating placeholder types Foo$Duplicate1, but these need furhter investigation.
 * (annotations): fix bug where to-level types get a preceeding `.` in their name
